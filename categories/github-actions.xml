We make sure we can live up to that goal by spending a significant amount of time working on impactful and critical infrastructure and projects within the Scientific Ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, our goals align with those of the &lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com"&gt;Chan Zuckerberg Initiative&lt;/a&gt; and, in particular, the &lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/rfa/essential-open-source-software-for-science/"&gt;Essential Open Source Software for Science&lt;/a&gt; (EOSS) program that supports tools essential to biomedical research via funds for software maintenance, growth, development, and community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CZI’s Essential Open Source Software for Science program supports software maintenance, growth, development, and community engagement for open source tools critical to science. And the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative was founded in 2015 to help solve some of society’s toughest challenges — from eradicating disease and improving education, to addressing the needs of our local communities. Their mission is to build a more inclusive, just, and healthy future for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we are thrilled to announce that the team at Quansight Labs &lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/czi-awards-16-million-for-foundational-open-source-software-tools-essential-to-biomedicine/"&gt;has been awarded&lt;/a&gt; five EOSS Cycle 4 grants to work on several projects within the PyData ecosystem. This post will introduce the successful grantees and their objectives for these two-year long grants.&lt;/p&gt;

This 2D plot shows a 16-day timeseries in the X axis.
  Each data point in the X axis corresponds to a cloud of 75 measurements (one per benchmark test).
  The y-axis spread of each cloud corresponds to the performance ratio. Ideal measurements would have
  a performance ratio of 1.0, since both runs returned the exact same performance. In practice this
  does not happen and we can observe ratios between 0.6 and 1.5. This plot shows that while there
  is an observable y-spread, it is small enough to be considered sensitive to performance
  regressions of more than 50%." src="https://labs.quansight.org/images/2021/08/github-actions-benchmark.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmarking software is a tricky business. For robust results, you need dedicated
hardware that only runs the benchmarking suite under controlled conditions. No other
processes! No OS updates! Nothing else! Even then, you might find out that CPU throttling,
thermal regulation and other issues can introduce noise in your measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how are we even trying to do it on a CI provider like GitHub Actions?
Every job runs in a separate VM instance with frequent updates and shared resources. It
looks like it would just be a very expensive random number generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a sensible way to do it: &lt;strong&gt;relative benchmarking&lt;/strong&gt;.
And we know it works because we have been collecting stability data points for several
weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
