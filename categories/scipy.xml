It was a lot of fun, and very productive. You can really feel that there's a lot of energy in the community, and that it's growing and maturing. This post is just a quick update to summarize Quansight's presence and contributions, as well as some of the more interesting things I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A few highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "Open Source Communities" track, which had a strong emphasis on topics like burnout, diversity and sustainability, as well as the keynotes by Stuart Geiger ("&lt;em&gt;The Invisible Work of Maintaining and Sustaining Open-Source Software&lt;/em&gt;") and Carol Willing ("&lt;em&gt;Jupyter: Always Open for Learning and Discovery&lt;/em&gt;") showed that many more people and projects are paying more attention to and evolving their thinking on the human and organizational aspects of open source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not go to many technical talks, but did make sure to catch Matt Rocklin's talk "&lt;em&gt;Refactoring the SciPy Ecosystem for Heterogeneous Computing&lt;/em&gt;". Matt clearly explained some key issues and opportunities around the state of array computing libraries in Python - I highly recommend watching this talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abigail Cabunoc Mayes' talk "&lt;em&gt;Work Open, Lead Open (#WOLO) for Sustainability&lt;/em&gt;" was fascinating - it made me rethink the governance models and roles we use for our projects, and I worked on some of her concrete suggestions during the sprints.&lt;/p&gt;
