&lt;p&gt;Today I'm incredibly excited to welcome Tania Allard to Quansight as
Co-Director of Quansight Labs. Tania (&lt;a href="https://github.com/trallard"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ixek/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bitsandchips.me/"&gt;personal
site&lt;/a&gt;) is a well-known and prolific PyData
community member. In the past few years she has been involved as a conference
organizer (JupyterCon, SciPy, PyJamas, PyCon UK, PyCon LatAm, JuliaCon and
more), as a community builder (PyLadies, NumFOCUS, RForwards), as a
contributor to Matplotlib and Jupyter, and as a regular speaker and mentor.
She also brings relevant experience in both industry and academia - she joins
us from Microsoft where she was a senior developer advocate, and has a PhD in
computational modelling.&lt;/p&gt;

improvements to the extension system. Theming is a way to extend JupyterLab and 
benefits from those improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While theming is often disregarded as a purely cosmetic endeavour, it can greatly
improve software. Theming can be great help for accessibility, and the Jupyter team
pays attention to making the default appearance accessibility-aware by using
sufficient contrast.  For users with a high visual acuity you may also choose 
to increase the information density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theming can also be a great way to improve communication by increasing or
decreasing emphasis of the user interface, which can be of use for teaching or
presenting. Theming may also help with security, for example, by having a clear
distinction between staging and production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally Theming can be a great way to express oneself, for example, by using
a branded version of software that fits well into a context, or expressing one's artistic
preferences or opinions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following blog post, we will show you step-by-step how you can
develop a custom theme for JupyterLab, distribute it, and take the example of the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyterlab-theme-winter"&gt;jupyterlab-theme-winter&lt;/a&gt; theme we release today to celebrate the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

This post is a general introduction of PyTorch-Ignite. It intends to give a brief but illustrative overview of what PyTorch-Ignite can offer for Deep Learning enthusiasts, professionals and researchers. Following the same philosophy as PyTorch, PyTorch-Ignite aims to keep it simple, flexible and extensible but performant and scalable.

The package has nearly 5 million downloads

&lt;h2&gt;But, what is Traitlets ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post we'll answer this question along with where Traitlets came from, its applications, and a bit of history.&lt;/p&gt;

(&lt;code&gt;.whl&lt;/code&gt;), and get byte for byte identical result to the wheels published on PyPI. This is a critical step toward being able
to &lt;em&gt;trust&lt;/em&gt; your computing platforms, and a key component to improve efficiency of build and packaging platforms. It also
potentially impacts fast conda environment creation for users. The following goes into some reasons for why you should care.&lt;/p&gt;

PyTorch (as part of a larger Quansight team) and contributing to Quansight Labs
supported community-driven projects in the Python scientific and data science
software stack, primarily to NumPy.  I have found my next home; the people, the
projects, and the atmosphere are an all around win-win for me and (I hope) for
the projects to which I contribute.&lt;/p&gt;

Six months ago I started a project with &lt;a href="https://github.com/CAM-Gerlach"&gt;CAM Gerlach&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/ccordoba12"&gt;Carlos Cordoba&lt;/a&gt; to improve Spyder’s documentation. At first, I didn’t actually understand how important docs are for software, especially for open source projects. However, during all this time I’ve learned how documentation has a huge impact on the open-source community and I’ve been thankful to have been able to do this. But, from the beginning, I asked myself “why am I the ‘right person’ for this?”&lt;/p&gt;

I decided to wait until now to write a blogpost about it because shortly after the initial release, we found several critical performance issues and some regressions with respect to Spyder 3, most of which are fixed now in &lt;a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases/tag/v4.1.2"&gt;version 4.1.2&lt;/a&gt;, released on April 3rd 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

At least, that's the impression we get from many developers: "writing docs is boring"; "it's a chore, nobody likes to do it". I have come to realize I'm one of those rare people who likes to write both code and documentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody will argue against documentation. It is clear that for an open-source software project, documentation is the public face of the project. The docs influence how people interact with the software and with the community. It sets the tone about inclusiveness, how people communicate and what users and contributors can do. Looking at the results of a “NumPy Tutorial” search on any search engine also gives an idea of the demand for this kind of content - it is possible to find documentation about how to read the NumPy documentation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've started working at Quansight in January, and I have started doing work related to the &lt;a href="https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2019/11/numpy-openblas-CZI-grant/"&gt;NumPy CZI Grant&lt;/a&gt;. As a former professor in mathematics, this seemed like an interesting project both because of its potential impact on the NumPy (and larger) community and because of its relevance to me, as I love writing educational material and documentation. Having official high-level documentation written using up-to-date content and techniques will certainly mean more users (and developers/contributors) are involved in the NumPy community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if everybody agrees on its importance, why is it so hard to write good documentation?&lt;/p&gt;
