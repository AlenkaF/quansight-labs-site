One of our main aims is to
channel more resources into community-driven PyData projects, to keep them
healthy and accelerate their development. &lt;em&gt;And do so in a way that projects
themselves stay in charge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post explains one method we're starting to use for this. I'm writing it
to be transparent with projects, the wider community and potential funders
about what we're starting to do. As well as to explicitly solicit feedback on
this method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Community work orders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you talk to someone about supporting an open source project, in particular a
well-known one that they rely on (e.g. NumPy, Jupyter, Pandas), they're often
willing to listen and help. What you quickly learn though is that they want
to know in some detail what will be done with the funds provided. This is
true not only for companies, but also for individuals. In addition, companies
will likely want a written agreement and some form of reporting about the
progress of the work. To meet this need we came up with &lt;em&gt;community work
orders&lt;/em&gt; (CWOs) - agreements that outline what work will be done on a project
(implementing new features, release management, improving documentation,
etc.) and outlining a reporting mechanism. What makes a CWO different from a
consulting contract? Key differences are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It must be work that is done on the open source project itself (and not e.g.
   on a plugin for it, or a customization for the client).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The developers must have a reasonable amount of freedom to decide what to
   work on and what the technical approach will be, within the broad scope of
   the agreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deliverables cannot be guaranteed to end up in a project; instead the funder
   gets the promise of a best effort of implementation and working with the
   community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Respecting community processes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point 3 above is particularly important: &lt;em&gt;we must respect how open source
projects make decisions&lt;/em&gt;. If the project maintainers decide that they don't
want to include a particular change or new feature, that's their decision to
make. Any code change proposed as part of work on a CWO has to go through the
same review process as any other change, and be accepted on its merits. The
argument "but someone paid for this" isn't particularly strong, nor is one
that reviewers should have to care about. Now of course we don't expect it to
be common for work to be rejected. An important part of the Quansight value
proposition is that because we understand how open source works and many of
our developers are maintainers and contributors of the open source projects
already, we propose work that the community already has interest in and we
open the discussion about any major code change early to avoid issues.&lt;/p&gt;
