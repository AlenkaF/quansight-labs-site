to prove this fact has turned up nearly nothing. There’s many ways that such a
gap in community might manifest, but one that I never anticipated was working
with developers that had never interacted with a designer before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick note for context: I’m writing this as a UX/UI designer working with
open source projects for a little over a year. Because there are so many ways
design processes can happen (enough to warrant its own blog post), this post is
not intended to discuss design process deeply. My goal here is to pass on some
of what I’ve learned that helps me design in this unusual space in hopes that
it can help someone else. This post might seem most relevant for designers, but
I think this experience could be helpful for developers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
