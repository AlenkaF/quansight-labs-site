&lt;h3&gt;JupyterLab Accessibility Journey Part 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be honest with you, I started asking accessibility questions
in JupyterLab spaces while filled with anxiety. Anxiety that I was shouting
into the void and no one else would work on accessibility with me. Anxiety
that I didn’t have the skills or energy or knowledge to back up what I
wanted to do. Anxiety that I was going to do it wrong and make JupyterLab
even more inaccessible. Sometimes I still feel that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, Spyder 5 was released at the beginning of April! This 
blog post is a conversation attempting to document the long and complex 
process of improving Spyder's UI with this release. Portions lead by Juanita 
Gomez are marked as &lt;strong&gt;Juanita&lt;/strong&gt;, and those lead by Isabela Presedo-Floyd are 
marked as &lt;strong&gt;Isabela&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What did we do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Juanita]&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/"&gt;Spyder&lt;/a&gt; was created more than 10 
years ago and it has had the contributions of a great number of developers 
who have written code, proposed ideas, opened issues and tested PRs in order 
to build a piece of Spyder on their own. We (the Spyder team) have been lucky 
to have such a great community of people contributing throughout the years, 
but this is the first time that we decided to ask for help from an UX/UI 
expert! Why? You might wonder. Having the contributions of this great amount 
of people has resulted in inconsistencies around Spyder’s interface which we 
didn’t stop to analyze until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Isabela joined Quansight, we realized that we had an opportunity of 
improving Spyder’s interface with her help. We thought her skill set was 
everything we needed to make Spyder’s UI better.  So we started by reviewing 
the results of a community survey from a few months ago and realized that 
some of the most common feedback from users is related to its interface 
(very crowded, not consistent, many colors). This is why we decided to start 
a joint project with Isabela, (who we consider now part of the Spyder team) 
called &lt;a href="https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases/tag/v5.0.0"&gt;Spyder 5&lt;/a&gt;!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;JupyterLab Accessibility Journey Part 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past few months, I've been part of a group of people in the JupyterLab community 
who've committed to start chipping away at the many accessibility failings of JupyterLab. 
I find this work is critical, fascinating, and a learning experience for everyone involved. 
So I'm going to document my personal experience and lessons I've learned in a series of blog 
posts. Welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

improvements to the extension system. Theming is a way to extend JupyterLab and 
benefits from those improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While theming is often disregarded as a purely cosmetic endeavour, it can greatly
improve software. Theming can be great help for accessibility, and the Jupyter team
pays attention to making the default appearance accessibility-aware by using
sufficient contrast.  For users with a high visual acuity you may also choose 
to increase the information density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theming can also be a great way to improve communication by increasing or
decreasing emphasis of the user interface, which can be of use for teaching or
presenting. Theming may also help with security, for example, by having a clear
distinction between staging and production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally Theming can be a great way to express oneself, for example, by using
a branded version of software that fits well into a context, or expressing one's artistic
preferences or opinions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following blog post, we will show you step-by-step how you can
develop a custom theme for JupyterLab, distribute it, and take the example of the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/jupyterlab-theme-winter"&gt;jupyterlab-theme-winter&lt;/a&gt; theme we release today to celebrate the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

Portions lead by Tim George are marked with
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;TG&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and those lead by Isabela Presedo-Floyd are marked with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;IPF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TG:&lt;/strong&gt; When I speak with other designers, one common theme I see concerning why
they chose this career path is they want to make a difference in the world. We
design because we imagine a better world and we want to help make it real. Part
of the reason we design as a career is we're unable to go through life without
designing; we're always thinking about how things are and how they could be
better. This ethos also exists in many open-source communities. It seems like it
ought to be an ideal match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what's the disconnect? I'm still exploring that myself, but after a few years
in open source I want to share my observations, experiences, and hope for a
stronger collaboration between design and development. I don't think I have a
complete solution, and some days I'm not even sure I grasp the entire problem.
What I hope is to say that which often goes unsaid in these spaces: design and
development skills in open source coexist precariously.&lt;/p&gt;

to prove this fact has turned up nearly nothing. There’s many ways that such a
gap in community might manifest, but one that I never anticipated was working
with developers that had never interacted with a designer before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick note for context: I’m writing this as a UX/UI designer working with
open source projects for a little over a year. Because there are so many ways
design processes can happen (enough to warrant its own blog post), this post is
not intended to discuss design process deeply. My goal here is to pass on some
of what I’ve learned that helps me design in this unusual space in hopes that
it can help someone else. This post might seem most relevant for designers, but
I think this experience could be helpful for developers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
