We make sure we can live up to that goal by spending a significant amount of time working on impactful and critical infrastructure and projects within the Scientific Ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, our goals align with those of the &lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com"&gt;Chan Zuckerberg Initiative&lt;/a&gt; and, in particular, the &lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/rfa/essential-open-source-software-for-science/"&gt;Essential Open Source Software for Science&lt;/a&gt; (EOSS) program that supports tools essential to biomedical research via funds for software maintenance, growth, development, and community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CZI’s Essential Open Source Software for Science program supports software maintenance, growth, development, and community engagement for open source tools critical to science. And the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative was founded in 2015 to help solve some of society’s toughest challenges — from eradicating disease and improving education, to addressing the needs of our local communities. Their mission is to build a more inclusive, just, and healthy future for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, we are thrilled to announce that the team at Quansight Labs &lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/czi-awards-16-million-for-foundational-open-source-software-tools-essential-to-biomedicine/"&gt;has been awarded&lt;/a&gt; five EOSS Cycle 4 grants to work on several projects within the PyData ecosystem. This post will introduce the successful grantees and their objectives for these two-year long grants.&lt;/p&gt;

At least, that's the impression we get from many developers: "writing docs is boring"; "it's a chore, nobody likes to do it". I have come to realize I'm one of those rare people who likes to write both code and documentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody will argue against documentation. It is clear that for an open-source software project, documentation is the public face of the project. The docs influence how people interact with the software and with the community. It sets the tone about inclusiveness, how people communicate and what users and contributors can do. Looking at the results of a “NumPy Tutorial” search on any search engine also gives an idea of the demand for this kind of content - it is possible to find documentation about how to read the NumPy documentation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've started working at Quansight in January, and I have started doing work related to the &lt;a href="https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2019/11/numpy-openblas-CZI-grant/"&gt;NumPy CZI Grant&lt;/a&gt;. As a former professor in mathematics, this seemed like an interesting project both because of its potential impact on the NumPy (and larger) community and because of its relevance to me, as I love writing educational material and documentation. Having official high-level documentation written using up-to-date content and techniques will certainly mean more users (and developers/contributors) are involved in the NumPy community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if everybody agrees on its importance, why is it so hard to write good documentation?&lt;/p&gt;
